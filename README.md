# My Setup for Emacs

## Install Emacs
I use Mac Catalina. Use the appropreate command if you use Linux, UNIX, Windows or others.

```
% brew install emacs
```

## Create `~/.emacs.d/init.el`
After emacs is installed, `~/.emacs.d` directory is automatically created. Create a config file named `init.el` and edit as you like.

```
% emacs ~/.emacs.d/init.el
```
Copy the `init.el` file in this git repository to your own `/.emacs.d/init.el`.
